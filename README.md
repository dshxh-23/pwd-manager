## üíæ Data Storage

All user data is stored in the `vaults/` directory.

* Each user has a separate file named `.username.json` (the username is lowercased and stripped of spaces).
* Example structure of the JSON:

```json
{
  "user_name": "dhyey",
  "master_password": "1234",
  "data": {
    "github.com": {
      "email": "me@example.com",
      "user_id": "dshxh-23",
      "password": "my_password"
    }
  }
}
```

## üí° Planned Enhancements

- **Command-line shortcuts**
  - Quick password retrieval using command-line arguments (e.g., `python main.py --name dhyey --pwd 1234 --acc github.com`)
- **Password Encryption**
  - Encrypt all stored passwords using the `cryptography` library (e.g., `Fernet`, PBKDF2 with salt)
- **Unit Tests**
  - Add test coverage for core features using `pytest`
- **Random Password Generator**
  - Add a tool to generate secure random passwords for new accounts
- **Improved CLI UI**
  - Use libraries like `tabulate` or `rich` for better table formatting and colored output
